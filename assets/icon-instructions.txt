Icon Instructions
===============

To add application icons, you need to place the following files in this directory:

1. For Windows:
   - icon.ico - 256x256 pixels ICO file

2. For macOS:
   - icon.icns - ICNS file (can be created from a 1024x1024 PNG using iconutil)

3. For Linux:
   - icon.png - 512x512 pixels PNG file

These icon files will be used when building the desktop application.

You can create these icons using image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or online icon generators.

For a simple placeholder, you can use any math-related icon or create a custom logo that represents the Alhassan Math Competition Platform.

After placing the icon files in this directory, the electron-packager will automatically use them when building the application for distribution.
