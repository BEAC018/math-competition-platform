# How to Share Your Django Application

There are several ways you can share your Django application with others:

## Option 1: Share via ngrok (Temporary Public URL)

1. Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download
2. Extract the downloaded file
3. Run the following command in the directory where you extracted ngrok:
   ```
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
4. Share the generated URL (looks like https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app) with others

## Option 2: Deploy to PythonAnywhere (Free Hosting)

PythonAnywhere offers free hosting for Django applications:

1. Sign up at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
2. Upload your code to PythonAnywhere
3. Set up a web app through their web interface
4. Share your PythonAnywhere URL

## Option 3: Share the Code Repository

If you want others to run your application locally:

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload your project
3. Share the repository link
4. Include instructions in the README.md for how to:
   - Clone the repository
   - Install requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
   - Run migrations (python manage.py migrate)
   - Create a superuser (python manage.py createsuperuser)
   - Start the server (python manage.py runserver)

## Requirements for Running Locally

Make sure to include the following files in your repository:
- requirements.txt (contains all dependencies)
- .gitignore (to exclude unnecessary files)
- README.md (with setup instructions)
